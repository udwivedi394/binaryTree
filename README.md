This project contains following operations on Binary Tree

1. Print the left most and right most nodes at each level
2. Print extreme alternate nodes
3. Prints the Top View of Binary Tree
4. Prints the diagonals of Binary Tree
5. Contains levelOrder and InOrder traversals without recursion

lowestCommonAncestor.py
6. Print the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary Tree
7. Print the distance between two nodes in binary Tree

maxDiffAncestor.py
8. Print the maximum difference between the node and its ancestors(all of them)

cloneBinTree.py
9. Clone the binary Tree with Random pointer.
10. Two methods implemented
11. Ist Method: Using Hashmap, Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
12. IInd Method: Temperory Modification of original Binary Tree, Time complexity: O(n), Space: O(1)

checkLargestBST.py
13. Returns the BST with maximum number of nodes in a binary Tree 

bottomView.py
14. Prints the bottom View of given Binary Tree

specialTreePreOrder.py
15. Converts the given preOrder traversal data into Special Binary Tree, where every node has either 0 or 2 children

ksumPath.py
16. Prints all the available path in Binary Tree with sum equal to given k
